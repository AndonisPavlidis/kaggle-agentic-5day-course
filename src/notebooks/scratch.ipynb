It aims to make building AI agents feel more like traditional software development, allowing for the creation of modular and scalable agentic architectures that can range from simple tasks to complex workflows. The ADK is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, meaning it can work with various AI models and be deployed in different environments, though it is optimized for the Google ecosystem, particularly Gemini models and Vertex AI.\n",
